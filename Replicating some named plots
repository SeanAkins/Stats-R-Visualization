Replicating some named plots
Module 2 worksheet

Question1:

Variable Type      	 Variable Name
Numeric	             Carat, depth, table, price, x, y, z
Ordered factor	     Cut, color, clarity

Question2:

The difference is due to the type of the explanatory variables. The carat is a continuous variable and the plot looks like an integrated one while using the color variable the graph looks broken to different categories of the color variable. 

Question3:

Assigning cut to color aesthetic results in a group of different colors since cut is a categorical variable while using carat as a color aesthetic results in the spectra of a single color. 

Question4:

Adding the clarity as the fill aesthetic is actually using colors to define what proportion of each diamond cut has a specific clarity.

Question5:

The fill position is a normalized plot of the bar chart that we just produced and the dodge position looks like a couple of bar charts for clarity variable within the cut variable.

Question6:

Histogram, which is the equivalent of bar chart for continuous variables.

Question7:

The new plot looks like a wiggly one since we removed a categorizing variable (color) and the geom_line tries to connect all the points together.
